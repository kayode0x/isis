# Isis

Isis was known for a lot of things. Over here, we're going to refer to her as the Goddess of protection. Why? Thepeer relies on OTPs to validate checkouts and links on the platform. Isis exists to serve as the bridge between the [existing implementation](https://github.com/ichtrojan/laravel-otp) and the threesome (Lucifer, Adam and Eve).

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/thepeerstack/isis
